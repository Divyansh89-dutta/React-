React js mein aapko ek state naam ki cheej milege us bande ko app mutable nahi krskte matlab ki directly uski value nahi hata yo jod sakte 

var state = [1,2,3,4];
% state.push(5); // state = [1,2,3,4,5]
 state.pop(); // state = [1,2,3,4]
 this is not allowed in react 
 correct way is 
 var state = [1,2,3,4];
 state = [1,2] is the correct way

aur ab jo padhai shuru hogi wo isi baare mein hogi ke state ko immutable way mein kasie update karein 

how to copy 
var state = [1,2,3,4,5];
var copy = [...state];
copy.pop()
is the correct way
